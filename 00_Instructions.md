hlt                                               ; Stops CPU from executing (it can ve resumed by an interupt)
jmp     label                                     ; Jumps to a given location, unconditionally (equivalent to goto in C)
cmp data1, data2                                  ; Verifies if data1 is equal to data2
je  label                                         ; Evaluates the result of the previous comparison instruction to determine whether to jump to the target label
jz                                                ; jz destination jumps to destination if zero flag is set

### Interacting with data

```

db data                                           ; Stands for "define byte". Writes given byte(s) to the assembled binary file. times number instructions ; Repeats given instruction or piece of data a number of time
dw data                                           ; Stands for "define word(s)". Writes given word(s) (2 byte value, encoded in little endian) to the assembled binary file.
lodsb,lodsw,lodsd                                 ; These instruction load a byte/word/double-word from DS:SI into AL/AX/EAX, then increment SI by the number of bytes loaded
or                                                ; Or destination, source perform bitwise OR between source and destination, stores result in destination
